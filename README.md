### To Run this Job

The raw read files must end in '_R1_PE_trimmed.fastq.gz' (forward) and '_R2_PE_trimmed.fastq.gz' (reverse) for the script to work. Alternatively, the job file can be edited to match the text of the file names of the R1 and R2 reads after the sample name.

Edit these items in the job file:

1. SAMPLEDIR_TRIM="path to trimmed reads directory"

After the '=' copy full path to the directory that contains the trimmed reads.

2. SAMPLEDIR_BASE="path to base project directory"

After the '=' copy the full path to the base directory. This is the directory where the output directory will be copied, and where the job file can be placed.

After the job is edited save it as 'fastqc_trimmed_loop.job' and run the job on hydra (qsub fastqc_trimmed_loop.job).
